-- The phone is not the identity. customers.id is.
--
-- 20260802020000 made the phone the identifier and had create_ticket resolve by
-- its digits, ahead of ת״ז. That closed a real duplication hole and introduced
-- a rule the garage cannot live with: one number, one customer.
--
-- A garage's numbers are not one person's. A couple shares a line and brings in
-- two cars. A company answers for a fleet, and each driver is billed
-- separately. A parent gives their number for a student's car. Under phone
-- resolution every one of those tickets was attached to whoever held the number
-- first — whatever name the advisor had just typed — and a ticket for the
-- second person could not be opened at all.
--
-- Resolution is now: an explicitly picked (garage-checked) customer_id, then
-- ת״ז. Nothing else. The phone stays on the ticket, stays on the customer and
-- stays searchable; what it no longer does is decide whose ticket this is. The
-- intake forms carry the other half: they say whose number it is and offer to
-- attach the ticket to that customer, which arrives here as customer_id. Going
-- ahead without taking the offer creates a second customer sharing the number,
-- which is the case this migration exists to allow.
--
-- ת״ז keeps identifying, because the database keeps it unique per garage
-- (customers_garage_id_number_key, partial on NOT NULL). Two people cannot hold
-- one, so a match is the person rather than a coincidence. The fill below still
-- refuses to move a number off the customer holding it — see 20260802020000 for
-- why that is a skip and not a constraint violation — and the forms now refuse
-- to save until the advisor either attaches the ticket to the holder or
-- corrects the number, instead of letting a ticket carry somebody else's.
--
-- Everything else is unchanged from 20260805010000_language_neutral_vocabulary.sql.

COMMENT ON FUNCTION "public"."create_ticket"("t" "jsonb", "works" "jsonb") IS
  'Atomic new-ticket path: assigns GAR-/W- numbers under a per-garage row lock, resolves the customer by an explicitly picked (and garage-checked) customer_id and then by ת״ז, and inserts the ticket with its works and parts in one transaction. The identity is customers.id. The phone is NOT resolved by: one number legitimately belongs to several customers, so the intake forms name the holder and send customer_id when the advisor attaches the ticket to them. ת״ז is optional and unique per garage. A name with neither creates no customer. Garage comes from current_garage_id(), never the payload. See docs/PRODUCTION.md §3.4, §3.5, §3.6.';

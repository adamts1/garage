-- Customer resolution in create_ticket, tightened twice.
--
-- 1. The phone is matched on its digits, not its punctuation. "050-123-4567",
--    "050 1234567" and "0501234567" are one person; an exact string compare
--    made three, which is the same duplication §3.6 set out to kill, only with
--    a hyphen instead of a name.
--
-- 2. A ticket carrying a customer name but neither ת״ז nor phone no longer
--    opens a customer record at all. It used to create one every time, so the
--    same walk-in accumulated a row per visit with nothing to ever match them
--    on again. The ticket still keeps customer_name / phone in its own columns,
--    so nothing is lost off the card — there is simply no orphan customer to
--    find later. Both intake forms now require a phone, so this is the floor
--    under a caller that skips them, not the normal path.
--
-- Everything else in the function is unchanged from the baseline.
